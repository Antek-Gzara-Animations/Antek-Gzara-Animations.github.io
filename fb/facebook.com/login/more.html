            Phishing attacks are counterfeit communications that appear to come from a trustworthy source but which can compromise all types of data sources.<br>
            Attacks can facilitate access to your online accounts and personal data, obtain permissions to modify and compromise connected systems--such as point of sale terminals and order processing systems--and in some cases hijack entire computer networks until a ransom fee is delivered.<br>
            <br><br>
            Sometimes hackers are satisfied with getting your personal data and credit card information for financial gain. In other cases, phishing emails are sent to gather employee login information or other details for use in more malicious attacks against a few individuals or a specific company.<br>
            Phishing is a type of cyber attack that everyone should learn about in order to protect themselves and ensure email security throughout an organization.
